This is a web management tool for a pet pension (dog, cat, others).

This project is a custom product developed on specefic requirements asked by a friend of mine, it isn't ABSOLUTLY claim to be the best Pet Pension management tool in the world (if it was for myself, I would have done something differently), I've wrote it just to combine a favor for a friend and the fun to write with some frontend technologies.

Technologies used:

- Bootstrap 4
- jQuery 3.2.1
- Select2table (3rd party js library for table management)
- i18n (3rd party js library for Internationalization)
- HTML5 and its LocalStorage future (where the app stores the datas)

You're free to download it from my GitHub profile, use it, modify and distribute it, just please give me a credit.

P.s. with standard Chrome setting you'll get CORS JS problem domain, so use Firefox or other browser o if you want to use it within Chrome allow all (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3102819/disable-same-origin-policy-in-chrome) or run it into a web server
